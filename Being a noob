I have started learning to code python 2 days ago on the 16 after I found out about Replit. Once I made a replit acount I looked around and found the
100 Days of code and so I started that. As of now when I am entering this I have completed 3/100 python challenges doing two in one day because I wanted to
get better and I was bored. I have now learned how to print use inputs and realy thats about it. I did work on a little game where you answer questoins and
follow along on the storyline. After I completed the 3rd challenge out of the 100 I did some reserch and started working on a game where you type and make
decisoins. I hope it turns out well. :) If you wanna suport me try to contact me and give me tips and help. If you want to know how you can reach me my
Github is Beb720 my Replit is BennettBrown5 and my Discord is Beb720 but I don't check discord that much.
