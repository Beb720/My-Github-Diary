I have started learning to code python 2 days ago on the 16 after I found out about Replit.
Once I made a replit acount I looked around and found the 100 Days of code and so I started that.
As of now when I am entering this I have completed 3/100 python challenges doing two in one day
because I wanted toget better and I was bored. I have now learned how to print use inputs and
really thats about it.I did work on a little game where you answer questoins andfollow along on
the storyline. After I completed the 3rd challengeout of the 100 I did some reserch and started
working on a game where you type and makedecisoins. I hope it turns out well. :) If you wanna
suport me try to contact me and give me tipsand help. If you want to know how you can reach me
my Github is Beb720 my Replit is BennettBrown5 and my Discord is Beb720 but I don't check discord
that much.

Dear Diary, (LOL)
Today I finished day 4/100 Days of Code. This is a Replit thing I am doing to help me learn Python
coding. For my 4th Day project it taught me how to change the color of the text. WHAT THE FREKING
HECK WHY IS THIS JUST ONE DAY NO WONDER IT TAKES 100 DAYS!!! But besides that I decided that I
should spend a lot of time writing over 200 lines of code for a game that I want to finish the
day of. So besides that for me 200 lines of code is a lot for me so I wrote all the code, and
everything was fine but once I reached 200 lines and was half way through chapter 2 of my
3 chapter personalized story. Of course I just wrote to be continued then played it to see if it
had problem... It had A LOT! like A LOT!!! A LOT! so I just published it on Replit then. So I made
a deal with myself that if I get even a little bit of love I would work to make that project better
but anyway you know the drill so tahts all for todays entree and. If you want to know how you can
reach me my Github is Beb720 my Replit is BennettBrown5 and my Discord is Beb720 but I don't check
discord that much.
